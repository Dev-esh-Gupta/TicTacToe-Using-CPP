I am writted this fun game completely using CPP language

Code is very simple I just followed the logic of Tic-Tac-Toe 

Tic-Tac-Toe is a 3*3 matrix game that can be played by 2 players.

There is a three choice to make when you run this code using Any IDE that support to run CPP code (Prefered Dev-C++)

1. for play game
2. read instruction
3. exit
